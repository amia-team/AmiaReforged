# Phase 3.3 Economy CQRS - Day 2 Progress

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Event Infrastructure Complete, Ready for Handlers

---

## Summary

Successfully created the event infrastructure for Phase 3.3. Established `IDomainEvent`, `IEventBus`, and the three core economy events. Updated `TransferGoldCommandHandler` to publish events. All 81 existing tests continue to pass.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Event Infrastructure ‚úÖ

**Created Core Event Types**:

1. **IDomainEvent** (`SharedKernel/Events/IDomainEvent.cs`)
   - Base interface for all domain events
   - Contains `EventId` and `OccurredAt` properties
   - Follows past-tense naming convention

2. **IEventBus** (`SharedKernel/Events/IEventBus.cs`)
   - Interface for publishing and subscribing to events
   - Async API design
   - Generic type support

3. **InMemoryEventBus** (`SharedKernel/Events/InMemoryEventBus.cs`)
   - Phase 3.3 implementation (synchronous)
   - Thread-safe with locking
   - Tracks published events for testing
   - Ready for Phase 4 replacement with Channel-based async version

### 2. Economy Events ‚úÖ

**Created 3 Domain Events**:

1. **GoldDepositedEvent** (`Economy/Events/GoldDepositedEvent.cs`)
   - Records gold deposited into a coinhouse
   - Contains: Depositor, Coinhouse, Amount, TransactionId, OccurredAt

2. **GoldWithdrawnEvent** (`Economy/Events/GoldWithdrawnEvent.cs`)
   - Records gold withdrawn from a coinhouse
   - Contains: Withdrawer, Coinhouse, Amount, TransactionId, OccurredAt

3. **GoldTransferredEvent** (`Economy/Events/GoldTransferredEvent.cs`)
   - Records gold transferred between personas
   - Contains: From, To, Amount, TransactionId, Memo, OccurredAt

### 3. Updated TransferGoldCommandHandler ‚úÖ

**Changes**:
- Added `IEventBus` dependency injection
- Publishes `GoldTransferredEvent` after successful transaction recording
- Updated unit tests to mock `IEventBus`
- All 81 tests passing

**Code Pattern**:
```csharp
// Record transaction
Transaction recorded = await _repository.RecordTransactionAsync(transaction, ct);

// Publish event
var evt = new GoldTransferredEvent(...);
await _eventBus.PublishAsync(evt, ct);

// Return success
return CommandResult.OkWith("transactionId", recorded.Id);
```

## Test Results

**All Economy Tests Passing**: ‚úÖ 81/81

- DepositGoldCommand: 11 tests
- TransferGoldCommand: 18 tests
- TransferGoldCommandHandler: 10 tests
- TransactionRepository: 15 tests
- TransactionEntity: 15 tests
- RegionPolicyResolver: 5 tests
- RegionPolicyResolverBehavior: 7 tests

**Build**: ‚úÖ No compilation errors
**Warnings**: Only unused property warnings in new event classes (expected)

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Event Timing
**Decision**: Publish events AFTER successful persistence
- Events represent "what happened" (past tense)
- Only publish if transaction commits successfully
- Event timestamp matches database timestamp

### 2. TransactionId Mismatch
**Issue**: Database uses `long Id`, but `TransactionId` value object uses `Guid`
**Resolution**: Use `TransactionId.NewId()` for now, add TODO comment
**Future**: Migrate database to use Guid IDs in Phase 4

### 3. Synchronous Event Bus
**Decision**: In-memory synchronous implementation for Phase 3.3
- Simple and testable
- No async complexity yet
- Easy to swap for Channel-based in Phase 4
- Thread-safe with locking

### 4. Event Bus Testing
**Pattern**: Mock `IEventBus` in unit tests
- Verify handler calls `PublishAsync`
- Integration tests will verify actual event delivery
- InMemoryEventBus tracks events for debugging

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Implement DepositGoldCommandHandler (2-3 hours)

**Tasks**:
1. ‚úÖ `DepositGoldCommand` exists (created Day 1)
2. ‚è≥ Create `DepositGoldCommandHandler` with BDD tests
3. ‚è≥ Create/update `ICoinhouseRepository`
4. ‚è≥ Publish `GoldDepositedEvent`

**Files to Create**:
- `Features/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/DepositGoldCommandHandler.cs`
- `Features/WorldEngine/Economy/Banks/ICoinhouseRepository.cs` (or update existing)
- `Tests/Systems/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/DepositGoldCommandHandlerTests.cs`

**Test Scenarios**:
- Given valid deposit ‚Üí Then balance increases and event published
- Given insufficient funds ‚Üí Then failure result
- Given invalid coinhouse ‚Üí Then failure result
- Given negative amount ‚Üí Then validation error (caught at value object level)
- Given repository exception ‚Üí Then graceful failure

### After DepositGoldCommandHandler: WithdrawGoldCommand

**Tasks**:
1. Create `WithdrawGoldCommand` with factory method
2. Write BDD tests (11+ tests like DepositGoldCommand)
3. Create `WithdrawGoldCommandHandler`
4. Balance validation (cannot withdraw more than available)
5. Publish `GoldWithdrawnEvent`

**Files to Create**:
- `Features/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/WithdrawGoldCommand.cs`
- `Features/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/WithdrawGoldCommandHandler.cs`
- `Tests/Systems/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/WithdrawGoldCommandTests.cs`
- `Tests/Systems/WorldEngine/Economy/Commands/WithdrawGoldCommandHandlerTests.cs`

## Architecture Notes

### Event Bus Service Binding

The `InMemoryEventBus` is registered via Anvil's `[ServiceBinding]` attribute:

```csharp
[ServiceBinding(typeof(IEventBus))]
public class InMemoryEventBus : IEventBus { ... }
```

This means it's automatically available for dependency injection in:
- Command handlers
- Query handlers
- Application services
- Tests (when using the full DI container)

### Event Subscribers (Phase 4)

Currently, no subscribers exist. In Phase 4, we'll add:
- Audit logging subscribers
- Notification subscribers
- Analytics subscribers
- Cross-aggregate event handlers

For now, events are published but not consumed (except for testing/debugging).

### Testing Pattern

**Unit Tests**: Mock `IEventBus`
```csharp
var mockEventBus = new Mock<IEventBus>();
var handler = new TransferGoldCommandHandler(repository, mockEventBus.Object);

// Verify event was published
mockEventBus.Verify(bus =>
    bus.PublishAsync(It.IsAny<GoldTransferredEvent>(), It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()),
    Times.Once);
```

**Integration Tests**: Use real `InMemoryEventBus`
```csharp
var eventBus = new InMemoryEventBus();
var handler = new TransferGoldCommandHandler(repository, eventBus);

await handler.HandleAsync(command);

// Verify event was published with correct data
var events = eventBus.PublishedEvents.OfType<GoldTransferredEvent>().ToList();
Assert.That(events, Has.Count.EqualTo(1));
Assert.That(events[0].Amount.Value, Is.EqualTo(100));
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Mismatch Between Value Objects and Database IDs
- **Issue**: `TransactionId` uses `Guid`, database uses `long`
- **Impact**: Can't directly map transaction ID to event
- **Resolution**: Use `TransactionId.NewId()` for events (temporary)
- **Future Fix**: Migrate to Guid IDs in Phase 4

### 2. Test-First Pays Off
- Updated handler to add event bus
- Tests caught missing dependency immediately
- Easy fix: add mock to test setup
- All tests green in minutes

### 3. Event Naming Convention
- Use past tense: `GoldDepositedEvent`, not `DepositGoldEvent`
- Events describe "what happened", not "what to do"
- Makes event sourcing clearer

### 4. Simple First, Complex Later
- In-memory event bus is simple and works
- No need for async channels/queues yet
- Can upgrade to Channel-based in Phase 4
- YAGNI principle applied successfully
