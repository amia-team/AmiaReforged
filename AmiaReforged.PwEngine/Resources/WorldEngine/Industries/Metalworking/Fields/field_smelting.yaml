Name: Smelting
Description: "Smelting is a fundamental metallurgical process where metal is extracted from its ore by heating it beyond the melting point, often with chemical reducing agents. This process separates the desired metal from impurities and other elements, resulting in purified metal that can be further refined or worked. The process requires careful control of temperature, atmosphere, and other conditions to achieve optimal results."

    Tier: Journeyman
    Prerequisites:
      - metallurgy_advanced
  - Name: Roasting
    Tag: advanced_processing
    Description: You know how to roast metal-bearing ores by heating them in air to drive off impurities like sulfur and carbon. This process prepares the ore for smelting by improving its metal content and making it more reactive.
    Tier: Apprentice
    Prerequisites:
      - metallurgy_advanced
  - Name: Refining
    Tag: ingot_refinement
    Description: You know how to take inferior ingots and turn them into better quality ingots. This process causes a loss of some material, meaning that you end up with less product than you started with, but a better quality result.
  - Name: Alloying
    Tag: alloying
    Tier: Apprentice
    Description: You now know how to take metals in either their ore or their ingot form and create rudimentary alloys such as brass, pewter, or bronze.
