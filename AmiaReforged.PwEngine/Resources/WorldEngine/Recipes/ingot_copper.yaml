Name: Copper Ingot

Description: Copper is a widely used metal found in many alloys, including bronze, which is nearly as effective as iron for forging weapons and armor, and brass, which offers the highest value increase among non-steel alloys. On its own, copper is a common, low-value metal and a poor choice for edged weapons, ranking as the second-worst material for slashing. However, it performs reasonably well when used for blunt weapons.
